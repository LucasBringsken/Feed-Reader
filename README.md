# 📰 Flutter Feed Reader

A small **RSS/Atom Feed Reader app** built with **Flutter**.  
This is a little side project I made to learn the basics of Flutter, state management, and local storage with **Hive**.  
It’s not a full product — just a fun learning experiment.

## 🧠 Why I built this

I wanted to try out Flutter and see how far I could get with just local data and a simple UI.  
The main goal was to understand:
- How to structure a small Flutter project  
- How to persist data locally with Hive  
- How to manage state and navigation  
- How to build a nice, minimal UI with Material Design
